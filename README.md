Goals
- Create an AWS application in which a client submits a request to a worker on EC2. The request is
composed of a list of integers.
- The EC2 worker is a Python application that receives the list (the request) and calculates the min, max,
mean, median and send them back to the client.
- After sending the response, the EC2 worker must write a log file describing this transaction as txt file
on S3 Amazon Storage Cloud.
- Additional details
– the client is limited to 10 numbers. If more numbers are entered, a message error should be sent
– numbers must be positive - again a message error is sent to the client if one of the number is not
positive
